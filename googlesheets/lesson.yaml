  Author: Detian Deng
  Type: Standard
  Organization: JHU Biostat
  Version: 2.4.2

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to the googlesheets lesson. The googlesheets package serves as 
      a Google Sheets R API that lets you access and manage Google spreadsheets 
      from R. 
    

- Class: text
  Output: The current swirl lesson is very much derived from the package
      vignettes, which can be found here
      "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/README.html"
      Now, let's begin our lesson.

<<<<<<< HEAD:googlesheets/lesson.yaml
- Class: text
  Output: First, make sure you have installed googlesheets package.
      To install, simply use command
      install.packages("googlesheets", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we load the googlesheets package.
=======
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Load the googlesheets package.
>>>>>>> jtleek/master:googlesheets/lesson.yaml
  CorrectAnswer: library(googlesheets)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(googlesheets)')
  Hint: library(googlesheets)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We also need to load the dplyr package, from which we use the %>% pipe
      operator, among other things. googlesheets usage does not require you to 
      use %>% though it was certainly designed to be pipe-friendly. This 
      vignette uses pipes but you will find that all the examples in the help 
      files use base R only.
  CorrectAnswer: library(dplyr)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(dplyr)')
  Hint: Try library(dplyr)

- Class: text
  Output: List your Google Sheets
      The gs_ls() function returns a data frame of the sheets you would see in 
      your Google Sheets home screen.
      "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/."
      This should include sheets that you own and may also show sheets owned by 
      others but that you are permitted to access, if you have visited the sheet
      in the browser. Expect a prompt to authenticate yourself in the browser at
      this point.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use gs_ls() to list your Google spreadsheets and assign it to a 
      variable named my_sheets.
  CorrectAnswer: my_sheets <- gs_ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_sheets <- gs_ls()')
  Hint: my_sheets <- gs_ls()

- Class: text
  Output: Get a Google Sheet to practice with
      Don’t worry if you don’t have any suitable Google Sheets lying around!
      The author published a sheet for you to practice with and have built 
      functions into googlesheets to help you access it. The example sheet holds
      some of the Gapminder data. Feel free to visit the Sheet in the browser.
      "https://w3id.org/people/jennybc/googlesheets_gap_url"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The code below will put a copy of this sheet into your Drive, titled 
      “Gapminder”. Have a try.
      gap <- gs_gap() %>% gs_copy(to = "Gapminder")
  CorrectAnswer: gap <- gs_gap() %>% gs_copy(to = "Gapminder")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap <- gs_gap() %>% gs_copy(to = "Gapminder")')
  Hint: Type gap <- gs_gap() %>% gs_copy(to = "Gapminder")

- Class: text
  Output: Go check for a sheet named “Gapminder” in your 
      Google Sheets home screen. "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/"
      You can also call gs_ls() again to see if the Gapminder sheet appears. 
      Give it a regular expression to narrow the listing down, if you like.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For example, try gs_ls("Gapminder")
  CorrectAnswer: gs_ls("Gapminder")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gs_ls("Gapminder")')
  Hint: Try gs_ls("Gapminder")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You might see two sheets named Gapminder in your home screen, this is a 
      bug caused by the swirl package, so you need to run gs_delete(gap) to delete one of them.
  CorrectAnswer: gs_delete(gap)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gs_delete(gap)')
  Hint: Try gs_delete(gap)

- Class: text
  Output: Register a Sheet
      If you plan to consume data from a sheet or edit it, you must first 
      register it. This is how googlesheets records important info about the 
      sheet that is required downstream by the Google Sheets or Google Drive 
      APIs. Once registered, you can print the result to get some basic info 
      about the sheet.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: googlesheets provides several registration functions. 
      Specifying the sheet by title? Use gs_title(). 
      By key? Use gs_key(), but this does not work within swirl lessons, you can try on your own. 
      Now let's register by title and assign it to a variable named gap.
  CorrectAnswer: gap <- gs_title("Gapminder")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap <- gs_title("Gapminder")')
  Hint: Try gap <- gs_title("Gapminder"). If you are getting an error that Gapminder is matched by multiple sheets, go to Google Sheets and delete one of the sheets with that name. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now print it to see what you got.
  CorrectAnswer: gap
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap')
  Hint: Try gap

<<<<<<< HEAD:googlesheets/lesson.yaml
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Worried that a spreadsheet's registration is out-of-date?
     You can re-register it by gap <- gap %>% gs_gs().
  CorrectAnswer: gap <- gap %>% gs_gs()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap <- gap %>% gs_gs()')
  Hint: gap <- gap %>% gs_gs()
=======
>>>>>>> jtleek/master:googlesheets/lesson.yaml

- Class: text
  Output: The registration functions gs_title(), and gs_gs() return a
      registered sheet as a googlesheet object, which is the first argument to
      practically every function in this package. Likewise, almost every
      function returns a freshly registered googlesheet object, ready to be
      stored or piped into the next command.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can use gs_browse() to visit the Sheet corresponding to a registered
      googlesheet in your browser. 
  CorrectAnswer: gap %>% gs_browse()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap %>% gs_browse()')
  Hint: gap %>% gs_browse()

- Class: text
  Output: Inspect a Sheet
      Once you’ve registered a Sheet, you can print it to get an overview of, 
      e.g., its worksheets, their names, and dimensions. 
      In addition, you can use gs_ws_ls() to get worksheet names as a character
      vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Read all the data in one worksheet
      gs_read() returns the contents of a worksheet as a data frame. Use the 
      argument ws to specify the worksheet of interest. Let's take a look at the
      worksheet "Oceania". (assign it to oceania)
  CorrectAnswer: oceania <- gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Oceania")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='oceania <- gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Oceania")')
  Hint: oceania <- gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Oceania")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now print oceania.
  CorrectAnswer: oceania
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='oceania')
  Hint: oceania

- Class: text
  Output: Read only certain cells
      You can target specific cells via the range argument. The simplest usage 
      is to specify an Excel-like cell range, such as range = “D12:F15” or 
      range = “R1C12:R6C15”. The cell rectangle can be specified in various 
      other ways, using helper functions. It can be degenerate, i.e. open-ended.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see the worksheep 2 with range "A1:D8".
  CorrectAnswer: gap %>% gs_read(ws = 2, range = "A1:D8")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap %>% gs_read(ws = 2, range = "A1:D8")')
  Hint: gap %>% gs_read(ws = 2, range = "A1:D8")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see the worksheep "Europe" with range cell_rows(1:4).
  CorrectAnswer: gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Europe", range = cell_rows(1:4))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Europe", range = cell_rows(1:4))')
  Hint: gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Europe", range = cell_rows(1:4))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see the worksheep "Asia" with range cell_limits(c(1, 4), c(5, NA)).
  CorrectAnswer: gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Asia", range = cell_limits(c(1, 4), c(5, NA)))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Asia", range = cell_limits(c(1, 4), c(5, NA)))')
  Hint: gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Asia", range = cell_limits(c(1, 4), c(5, NA)))

- Class: text
  Output: Create a new Google Sheet
      You can use gs_new() to create a new Sheet de novo and populate it with a 
      bit of the iris data.
      And gs_read() is a wrapper that bundles together the most common methods 
      to read data from the API and transform it for downstream use.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a new Google sheet by
      boring_ss <- gs_new("boring", ws_title = "iris-gs_new", input = head(iris), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
  CorrectAnswer: boring_ss <- gs_new("boring", ws_title = "iris-gs_new", input = head(iris), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boring_ss <- gs_new("boring", ws_title = "iris-gs_new", input = head(iris), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)')
  Hint: boring_ss <- gs_new("boring", ws_title = "iris-gs_new", input = head(iris), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Access the newly created worksheet by pass it to gs_read().
  CorrectAnswer: boring_ss %>% gs_read()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boring_ss %>% gs_read()')
  Hint: boring_ss %>% gs_read()

- Class: text
  Output: Note how we store the returned value from gs_new() (and all other sheet editing 
      functions). That’s because the registration info changes whenever we edit 
      the sheet and we re-register it inside these functions, so this idiom will
      help you make sequential edits and queries to the same sheet. 
      You can copy an entire Sheet with gs_copy() and rename one with 
      gs_rename().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use gs_ws_new() to add some mtcars data as a second worksheet to boring_ss.
      boring_ss <- boring_ss %>% gs_ws_new(ws_title = "mtcars-gs_ws_new", input = head(mtcars), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
  CorrectAnswer: boring_ss <- boring_ss %>% gs_ws_new(ws_title = "mtcars-gs_ws_new", input = head(mtcars), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boring_ss <- boring_ss %>% gs_ws_new(ws_title = "mtcars-gs_ws_new", input = head(mtcars), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)')
  Hint: boring_ss <- boring_ss %>% gs_ws_new(ws_title = "mtcars-gs_ws_new", input = head(mtcars), trim = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Access this new worksheet by gs_read() with ws = 2.
  CorrectAnswer: boring_ss %>% gs_read(ws = 2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boring_ss %>% gs_read(ws = 2)')
  Hint: boring_ss %>% gs_read(ws = 2)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We use gs_ws_delete() and gs_ws_rename() to delete the mtcars worksheet and 
      rename the iris worksheets, respectively. Let's delete the second 
      worksheet in boring_ss and rename the remaining worksheet to "iris".
      Note that these functions can be piped together.
  CorrectAnswer: boring_ss <- boring_ss %>% gs_ws_delete(ws = 2) %>% gs_ws_rename(to = "iris")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boring_ss <- boring_ss %>% gs_ws_delete(ws = 2) %>% gs_ws_rename(to = "iris")')
  Hint: boring_ss <- boring_ss %>% gs_ws_delete(ws = 2) %>% gs_ws_rename(to = "iris")

- Class: text
  Output: Edit cells
      There are two ways to edit cells within an existing worksheet of an 
      existing spreadsheet.
      - gs_edit_cells() can write into an arbitrary cell rectangle
      - gs_add_row() can add a new row to the bottom of an existing cell rectangle

- Class: text
  Output: The previous two functions are both slow and you’re better off using gs_upload()
      to create a new sheet from a local file. We'll get to that later.
      Of the two, gs_add_row() is faster, but it can only be used when your data
      occupies a very neat rectangle in the upper left corner of the sheet.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We create a new Sheet, foo, and set up some well-named empty worksheets to 
      practice with. Try the following command.
      foo <- gs_new("foo") %>% gs_ws_rename(from = "Sheet1", to = "edit_cells") %>% gs_ws_new("add_row")
  CorrectAnswer: foo <- gs_new("foo") %>% gs_ws_rename(from = "Sheet1", to = "edit_cells") %>% gs_ws_new("add_row")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='foo <- gs_new("foo") %>% gs_ws_rename(from = "Sheet1", to = "edit_cells") %>% gs_ws_new("add_row")')
  Hint: foo <- gs_new("foo") %>% gs_ws_rename(from = "Sheet1", to = "edit_cells") %>% gs_ws_new("add_row")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use gs_edit_cells() to add the first six rows of iris data, e.g. use head(iris),
      into the blank sheet, edit_cells. Remember to trim the worksheet extent.
  CorrectAnswer: foo <- foo %>% gs_edit_cells(ws = "edit_cells", input = head(iris), trim = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='foo <- foo %>% gs_edit_cells(ws = "edit_cells", input = head(iris), trim = TRUE)')
  Hint: foo <- foo %>% gs_edit_cells(ws = "edit_cells", input = head(iris), trim = TRUE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use gs_edit_cells() to initialize sheet, add_row, with column headers and the 
      first row of data. Remember to trim your sheet.
  CorrectAnswer: foo <- foo %>% gs_edit_cells(ws = "add_row", input = head(iris, 1), trim = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='foo <- foo %>% gs_edit_cells(ws = "add_row", input = head(iris, 1), trim = TRUE)')
  Hint: foo <- foo %>% gs_edit_cells(ws = "add_row", input = head(iris, 1), trim = TRUE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Add the second row of data using gs_add_row() to the worksheet add_row. 
  CorrectAnswer: foo <- foo %>% gs_add_row(ws = "add_row", input = iris[2, ])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='foo <- foo %>% gs_add_row(ws = "add_row", input = iris[2, ])')
  Hint: foo <- foo %>% gs_add_row(ws = "add_row", input = iris[2, ])

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: gs_add_row() will actually handle multiple rows at once, try adding the last six
      rows of the iris data, e.g. use tail(iris)
  CorrectAnswer: foo <- foo %>% gs_add_row(ws = "add_row", input = tail(iris))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='foo <- foo %>% gs_add_row(ws = "add_row", input = tail(iris))')
  Hint: foo <- foo %>% gs_add_row(ws = "add_row", input = tail(iris))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's inspect our work, e.g. the edit_cells worksheet, using gs_read()
  CorrectAnswer: foo %>% gs_read(ws = "edit_cells")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='foo %>% gs_read(ws = "edit_cells")')
  Hint: foo %>% gs_read(ws = "edit_cells")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's inspect our work, the add_row worksheet, using gs_read()
  CorrectAnswer: foo %>% gs_read(ws = "add_row")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='foo %>% gs_read(ws = "add_row")')
  Hint: foo %>% gs_read(ws = "add_row")

- Class: text
  Output: Go to your Google Sheets home screen, find the new sheet foo and admire it. You 
      should see some iris data in the worksheets named edit_cells and add_row. 
      You could also use gs_browse() to take you directly to those worksheets.

- Class: text
  Output: Protip - If your edit populates the sheet with everything it should have, set 
      trim = TRUE and we will resize the sheet to match the data. Then the 
      nominal worksheet extent is much more informative (vs. the default of 1000
      rows and 26 columns) and future consumption via the cell feed will 
      potentially be faster.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Delete Sheets
      Use gs_delete() to delete entire Sheets. Let’s clean up by deleting the 
      foo spreadsheet.
  CorrectAnswer: gs_delete(foo)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gs_delete(foo)')
  Hint: gs_delete(foo)

- Class: text
  Output: If you’d rather specify sheets for deletion by title, look at gs_grepdel() and 
      gs_vecdel(). These functions also allow the deletion of multiple sheets at
      once.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make new Sheets from local delimited files or Excel workbooks
      Use gs_upload() to create a new Sheet de novo from a suitable local file. 
      First, we’ll write then upload a comma-delimited excerpt from the iris 
      data. Try the following command.
      iris %>% head(5) %>% write.csv("iris.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  CorrectAnswer: iris %>% head(5) %>% write.csv("iris.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris %>% head(5) %>% write.csv("iris.csv", row.names = FALSE)')
  Hint: iris %>% head(5) %>% write.csv("iris.csv", row.names = FALSE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use gs_upload() to create a new Sheet from file iris.csv. Assign it to a 
      variable named iris_ss.
  CorrectAnswer: iris_ss <- gs_upload("iris.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris_ss <- gs_upload("iris.csv")')
  Hint: iris_ss <- gs_upload("iris.csv")

- Class: text
  Output: You can use gs_upload() to upload a multi-sheet Excel workbook as well.



- Class: text
  Output: Download Sheets as csv, pdf, or xlsx file
      Use gs_download() to download a Google Sheet as a csv, pdf, or xlsx file. 
      Downloading the spreadsheet as a csv file will export the first worksheet 
      (default) unless another worksheet is specified.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's register the work sheet "Gapminder" by its title and download its "Africa"
      worksheet and save the file as "gapminder-africa.csv".
  CorrectAnswer: gs_title("Gapminder") %>% gs_download(ws = "Africa", to = "gapminder-africa.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gs_title("Gapminder") %>% gs_download(ws = "Africa", to = "gapminder-africa.csv")')
  Hint: gs_title("Gapminder") %>% gs_download(ws = "Africa", to = "gapminder-africa.csv")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Or you can download the entire spreadsheet as an Excel workbook. Let's call it 
      "gapminder.xlsx".
  CorrectAnswer: gs_title("Gapminder") %>% gs_download(to = "gapminder.xlsx")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gs_title("Gapminder") %>% gs_download(to = "gapminder.xlsx")')
  Hint: gs_title("Gapminder") %>% gs_download(to = "gapminder.xlsx")
